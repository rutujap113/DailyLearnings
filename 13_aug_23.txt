size_t: 
us when task related to indexing, memory allocation.
Why: no negative value

`size_t` is a data type in C and C++ that's primarily used to represent the size of objects in memory. It's an unsigned integer type, which means it can only hold non-negative values. It's often used for indexing arrays, representing memory allocation sizes, and any other scenario where you need to represent the size of data structures.

`size_t` is particularly important when dealing with memory-related operations, like memory allocation and dealing with array indices, because it ensures platform-independent representation of object sizes, considering the specific memory architecture of the system.

Some common scenarios where you should use `size_t` include:

1. **Array Indexing**: When indexing arrays, you should use `size_t` as the index type. This ensures that the index cannot be negative and can accommodate the maximum possible array size on the given system.

2. **Memory Allocation**: Functions like `malloc` or `new` in C and C++ use `size_t` as an argument to specify the size of memory to be allocated.

3. **Loop Iterations**: When you're looping over an array or a collection of items, use `size_t` for loop counters.

4. **String Length**: Functions like `strlen` return `size_t` as the length of strings.

Alternatives to `size_t` include:

1. **`int`**: While `int` can be used for array indexing and loop counters, it's not the best choice for representing sizes or indices in memory operations. It has a sign bit that can be problematic when dealing with sizes that should only be positive.

2. **`unsigned int`**: Similar to `int`, this can also be used for sizes, but `size_t` is specifically designed for this purpose and is more explicit.

3. **`ptrdiff_t`**: This is another integer type that's used to represent the difference between two pointers. It's mainly used for pointer arithmetic and addressing differences between two pointers.

4. **`ssize_t`**: This is used to represent sizes and indices in situations where negative values are meaningful (like file I/O). It's signed and is not typically used for memory-related operations.

It's important to use `size_t` appropriately in scenarios where it makes sense, especially when dealing with memory-related operations. This ensures compatibility across different systems and platforms.
